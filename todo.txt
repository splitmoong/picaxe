#components/cards/imagecard.py |
-------------------------------|
-implement the compress button
    -it opens the popover component underneath




#create new components/popover/popover.py |
------------------------------------------|
-implement a popover component that displays
    -a slider to change compression % and a target size which updates in real time
    -an text field where user can input the target size




#logic/compressor.py |
---------------------|
-implement a compressor class
    -understand how to compress the image in-memory to calculate the final image size. (yes I was today years old when I came to know that you cannot compute the final size before actually compressing at least once)
    maybe, if I can compress it once, I can then calculate the final size without doing further calculations?
